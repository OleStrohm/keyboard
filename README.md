# Custom Rust-based split keyboard
_Currently in the prototyping stage_

A custom made keyboard with Rust firmware.

## Hardware
The keyboard will be made using a custom PCB, made in two parts as it is a split keyboard.

The final design will be made to the specification that fits my hand the best.

## Firmware
Once protoype PCB has been assembled the development of the firmware will begin.
The firmware will be written in Rust.

## Current design
